Often the problems were associated with corn seedlings leafing out underground and it\u2019s likely weather and seedbed conditions were responsible for the occurrence of the abnormal growth. Seedlings exhibiting abnormal emergence may have a twisted appearance because internal leaves start expanding before the seeding has elongated. \u201cCorkscrewed\u201d mesocotyl/coleoptile development may occur when the coleoptile encounters resistance \\n(like soil crusting or a dense soil surface\\n) as the mesocotyl elongates. Several factors \\n(or combination of factors\\n) may be responsible for this abnormal growth. These factors may be characterized as environmental, chemical, or mechanical. Environmental conditions associated with underground leafing include light penetration, cold soils, or heavy rains soon after planting. When plants unfurl below the soil surface, they usually turn yellow and die. \\n\\r\\nIn a cloddy field where soil coverage of seed is poor and irregular, sunlight can reach the germinating seedling and induce leaf emergence beneath the soil surface. Also, heavy rains after planting can cause a hard crust, which makes emergence of small seedlings very difficult \\n(this seemed to be the most likely factor causing problems this year\\n). As a result, bending and twisting of the seedling below the crusted layer often occurs. Planting the seed too deep has also been associated with premature unfurling of the corn. \\n\\r\\nCertain herbicides, such as cell growth inhibitors like acetochlor, and various premixes that contain their active ingredients can show similar symptoms \\n(i.e. twisting, abnormal growth\\n) when excessive rates are applied pre-emergence. Besides excessive rates, improperly closed seed furrows can allow the pre-emergence herbicide to come in direct contact with the seed. \\n\\r\\nIn a 2012 article concerning corn emergence problems \\n(http://www.agry.purdue.edu/ext/corn/news/timeless/Corkscrews.html\\n), Dr. Bob Nielsen at Purdue University notes that cold soils and/or wide fluctuations in soil temperatures throughout the day during the emergence process may be a major contributing factor for the development of corkscrewed mesocotyl. We have also encountered some swings in soil temperatures during emergence in areas where problems occurred. \\n\\r\\nCorn seedlings that exhibit abnormal unfurling symptoms during emergence will be unable to penetrate any but the loosest soil even if the crust is broken mechanically or softened by rain. Prompt treatment with a rotary hoe, weeder, spiketooth harrow or cultipacker may help break the crust and improve emergence. However, even when used carefully, these salvage operations can cause some damage to seedlings, which are emerging normally. To minimize poor seedling emergence due to unfurling below the soil surface, watch for cloddy seedbeds, open seed furrows, and crusting surface soils after rains. \\n\\r\\nReferences \\n\\r\\nNielsen, R.L. 2012.

You just won't ever do it.

You add selenium to the diet. Sodium? In the feed. Iron/Copper/Cobalt etc etc etc? WAY cheaper and easier and more effective to just feed these materials to the animal directly. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nYou guys seem to want to farm the ideal soil all the time. Correct this, ratio that, add this, it's quite interesting, but us numbskulls over here mange to get 10-12t/ha Wheat and 5t/ha Canola and we don't give two hoots about the soil beyond pH, P, K and S.

That tiny volume per hectare is plenty enough to keep that plant going and provide the milligrams of trace element it needs to work, whether the soil can provide it or not. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nStart to think about what the plant wants.

They start feeding on corn here at 3-4 leaves. Doing some now at waist high.

The deer continued feeding on dry ears until I harvested the corn. Any stalks that fell over or ears had dropped off to the ground, the deer cleaned up every kernel through the winter. Combine broke down with about a half acre left to harvest. Weather set in and that was the end of harvesting. In a month there was not an ear with a kernel on it left in the field.

Therefore, successful pollination does not always result in fertilization. Pollen shed begins shortly after the corn tassel is fully emerged from the whorl \\n(VT stage\\n). Pollen shed usually lasts for 5 to 8 days with peak shed by the 3rd day. Flowering typically occurs in the morning with delays during rain or excessive humidity. Hot, dry conditions can reduce pollen viability and decrease length of shed. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nA day or two of wet weather in the morning isn't a big deal, pollination won't be impacted.  But if it stays wet for quite a few days and silks continue to grow, what happens is some silks start to get covered, and may not be pollinated due to that excessive growth.  This is a result of some silks getting covered up by others making it difficult for the pollen grain to get to some silks, so you could see some random misses around the ear, depending on when the wet mornings occurred in the pollination process.  The first silks to emerge from the ear are from the base, and it continues to emerge working up the ear, to the tip silks being the last to emerge.  Also, silks are are receptive to pollen for 5-6 days.

Field was fall moldboard plowed, this spring it was hit with the disc and then field cultivator, then planted. 15\" rows.  Sprayed with RUP 30 days after plant (RR soys). Planned to do a 2nd app of RUP 30 days after that, but excess rain kept the field too wet and then beans were too big by the time it dried up.  RUP did not stop this weed, in fact the grass looked barely hit (slowed down, best way to describe). That was ~4\" high when it was sprayed.  What strategies have worked for you or would you suggest? I'm a complete amateur and clearly failing on management of this one.  Currently hire our spraying, but looking to set up our own for next year so we can setup and not trample the beans.   The upside is back when I was a kid, yellow mustard was the issue, spent many a day with a hoe walking rows. The last few years, giant ragweed was the problem. Those are mostly under control, but now this giant grass is taking their place.  Some of this field will be soys next year, the other will be wheat (SRW).  ",

Generally, for each day that sulfur is deficient past the first 21 days after emergence there is a loss of 1 to 2 bushels per acre to the point that total crop failure could be experienced. Certainly, if sulfur is deficient at silking, yields could be reduced by up to 75%. Therefore, it is critical that these early deficiency symptoms be rectified quickly by applying sulfur.

They were Golden Harvest 9138 3000Gt.  1498 is Pioneer 1498HR, 15B80 is a non-GMO hybrid.  Those are all within 100 rows. \\n\\r\\nThose all got the 100 lbs of N as spring applied AA, then 150 lb AMS, 100lb pell gypsum, 50 lb Potash, and 1 lb actual Boron topdressed atV5. Half the field also got 10 lb Copper Sulfate. 40lb N as 32-0-0 was fertigated on at very early VT \\n(maybe 20% tassels showing\\n)   220 APH ground \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nThe Z35 field is not under the pivot, it has limited flood irrigation.  It got 130 lb N as spring applied AA and the same dry blend of 150 lb AMS, 100 lb gypsum, 50 lb Potash, and 1 lb actual Boron topdressed at V5.  No fertigation on that field.  200 APH ground \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nA day after this latest sample was taken, both fields had 1 qt chelated Manganese \\n(6%\\n) and 1.25 qt Boron \\n(10%\\n) flown on with the fungicide .   \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\n It seems to me that the low K from the week before resulted from the very rapid vegetative growth stage the plant had just finished when it simply couldn't take up K fast enough.

  "question": "Hello,  I have planted a few acres of sweetcorn and they are quiet sick. Previously the field had turf (sod) by my cousin. The turf is a buffalo variety and in its last season it had yellowing leaves. A few local growers had the same and it was attributed to a mosaic virus.

Am I going over board on sulfur? Will the zinc be available? What timing for kts?",

  "answer": "i don't think in our area you can go overboard on sulfur, and i really think it makes our n more efficient. i think you are going to need more zinc if you want to get away from the liquid in furrow some day. for now i would keep it. would you consider side dressing nh3 on 1/2 the pivot. by side dressing you would also have the ability to run some strips at different rates and record them to see where you are at for needs, and for future reference. also corn really likes ammonium n later in the season, what better way to keep it in that form longer than a later app"

One heavy rain and it moves it down to the root and the plant picks it up through the root.  Had a few spots this year where you could see the overlaps with the sprayer boom from last year.  Knee high beans were cupped just like that and wrinkled.  It grew out of it but took longer to close the row and had maybe a 25% stand reduction.  It was by far worst on low OM soils.  It affects the newest growth first as it\\'s the most active.

Dig the soil under that plant and look for indications of poor percolation/anaerobicity. You can also soil sample good and bad areas. In areas of natural acidity and first time conversion from pasture to beans, I prefer to split soil cores into 0-4\" and 4-8\" depth and look at shallow acidity issues...the fertility will often be \\'stratified\\'. Aluminum exchange is a separate but worthwhile test....IMO. Grasses generally much more tolerant of high Al levels and better growth. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nI see the same symptoms here where subsoil acidity is high AND there is poor percolation. The soils are 300 mil yrs old and parent material is sandstone or shale with very little Ca containing rock so shallow acidity and aluminum toxicity are very real issues HERE. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nSoy plants grow normal during periods of frequent rainfall,  BUTTT once the topsoil dries then soil water from the subsoil rises to the top through capillary action bring dissolved aluminum with it. Soys are Al intolerant and root pruning begins as Al levels climb and is coupled with stunted growth and leaves like you see. I have also seen normal soy plants totally succomb to drought in 2-3 weeks. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nIf you get sufficient rain for shallow root feeding the plants may grow out of it some. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nHere is a 2010 pic of a soil problem area with poor perc and high shallow acidity.

Not sure if it applies to you or not: \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nBrown to Purple Colored Wheat Leaves \\n\\r\\nRoger Don Gribble, OCES Area Extension Agronomist \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nWheat producers are experiencing different growth habits to wheat plants this year.  One of those different changes is a color difference in the plant from green to a brown or purple colored cast to the wheat leaves.  There can be several explanations to the color change and it appears to be a field by field decision as to what is happening. If a producer evaluates the following possibilities, perhaps he can determine which production problem answers his wheat plants color change. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nOne of the possible reasons for this discoloration in the plant leaves may be phosphorus induced.  Research has demonstrated that all plants will exhibit a purple color when phosphorus is in a limited supply.  Producers will need to look at their soil test to determine if this condition excises.  Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service suggests having your soil tested at least every three years to determine nutrient needs and apply the nutrients according to soil test recommendations. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nThrough research at the OSU Experiment Stations, we have seen a purplish color to wheat when the soil pH level is low enough to cause an aluminum toxicity problem in wheat.  When the soil pH level drops below 5.5, the soluble aluminum levels in soil begin to increase.  The soluble aluminum forms a rock compound with phosphorus molecules to form aluminum phosphate.  This rock compound does not allow phosphorus to be available for plant uptake.  Without free phosphorus compounds in the soil, a producer could see a purplish color in his wheat plant.    \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nA third condition involving phosphorus is that phosphorus is an immobile element in the soil.  Plant roots need to grow to phosphorus in order to extract the element from the soil.  Growth conditions for wheat have not been favorable this year.  Not being able to extract the phosphorus from the soil could be another possibility for seeing purple wheat plants in northwest Oklahoma fields. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nAnother option for producer to evaluate in their fields will be insect feeding.  In the past, aphids have vectored a disease called Barley Yellow Dwarf to wheat plants.  We normally see the purple color of wheat caused by this disease during the boot stage of growth in the spring.  Scientists have seen this purple color earlier in the fall where aphid feeding has occurred.  For the fall of 2000, aphid feeding has been minimal.   \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nApplications of weed control products have been known to color plants purple.  The wheat plants must absorb the applied product, metabolize the product and begin its regrowth.  As the wheat plant metabolizes the applied product, wheat may give a purplish cast to its leaves.  If this is a cause of the purple color, producers need only to look at the application date on their latest bill to determine if this is a cause.  \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nOne last possibility involves a sugar build up in the plant.  This sugar buildup contains a pigment known as anthocyanin.  This pigment is reddish to purplish colored pigment.  Anthocyanin is found in most plants and is involved in color changes of plants in the fall of the year.  Just like when leaves of our elm and oak trees change in the fall, anthocyanin is present in wheat leaves.  When the sugars with anthocyanin present build up in the wheat plant, we can see those same color changes in the leaves of wheat. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nIf a wheat producer can eliminate all other possible solutions to the purple colored cast in his wheat leaves, the build up of the pigment anthocyanin could be his answer.  Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Agriculture Educators located in every county can assist in identifying your production problems. \\n\\r\\n', 'reply_id': 1782227, 'image_urls': []}, '1782291': {'text': \"It looks like barley yellow dwarf.

  "answer": "that is one option, could also be soil or fertility variability. probably should have flagged each matching plant and dug up roots/seed. hard part is finding all seeds are same depth so was seed in a void due to poor closing wheel performance or dry soil. was listening to a corn breeder obsess over uniform ear size, his thing was to vary population to get same ear size across the field. this year 200+ yield areas were small and 0-100 areas were too big, obvious looking at ear size or total lack thereof. in the end it seems it is all about soil variability \"here\" and yield maps seem like a very crude way to map soils."

I already have the Injection system that CR supply sells, and it paid for itself in the first 100 acres due to the savings using generic capture vs. capture lfr. I will attach the snippet from becks research report on capture.",

  "answer": "nice looking beans. where abouts are you located? we farm just north of mt. vernon in knox and richland county. are beans are looking good here but we need to keep getting some timely rain. august weather here is so important for beans. i have seen some really tall nice looking beans that end up not doing so good and some short beans that will be great. i think if august weather cooperates we have a good chance for some good crops this fall. good luck with yours"

I am not worried about it but my thinking was that the corn has used extra nutrients out of the soil to put on two suckers that have grown to about the same height as the main stalk. The suckers have put out a tassel but with a corn ear that makes up the stem of the tassel, this first picture. I know these will not make anything but I also have found ear shoots on the suckers and it is doubtful they will make but they are there which is not the norm and there is hope. \\n\\r\\n \\n\\r\\nNow to the real info or opinions that I am after.

  "answer": "in the past i did some ams late season on beans and it worked out great.\n\nthese beans were side dressed with 250lbs of super u (treated urea) 40 p, 40 k, and 100 ams back in late june. all summer long you couldn't see much difference. but now you can. very interested in what the scale says for yield if its cash worthy or not!!\n\nfor us mother nature is king. all the fertilizer means nothing if we don't get july/august rains. or get an early frost.\n\nat 2500 beans /pound, 150k stand, 30pods per plant means that big plant in theory is 90 bushel beans. i know that isn't going to happen but just some calculator fun!! 29 bu. aph is going to go up a little after this year?!!!"

Glyphosate was sprayed back on July 3.  It seems to be on mainly just the most upper leaves. The affected  leaves kind of have a funny wrinkle to them too. I should have took a pic of the back side of them but they seemed to look the same as the tops. Also have a different variety in the field I should check to see if the have the same thing going on. They seem to be flowering and setting pods decent so I don't real think it is hurting any thing yet but since it is mainly on the newest leaves it must have just started in the last few days. Didn't notice it a week ago when I was out chasing water hemp escapes with the bean buggy. Wouldn't have missed it because they are really speckled. I'll do some more checking tomorrow.
